*** How does the original game do it?
** It's possible for a user to get asked the same question twice.
*** There are enough questions that this isn't a big deal.

* This question:

	Which US state had a higher percentage of adults commuting to work by public transportation in 2010?

is ambiguous. I think it's asking: of people commuting to work, how many do it by public transportation? The answer is given in "% of commuting workers", which fits. But the reference class isn't obvious from the question, and sounds like it should just be "adults".

* Add way to delete credence game data, possibly from settings page.

* Put a link on the main page.
